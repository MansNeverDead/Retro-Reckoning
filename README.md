# Retro Reckoning
From here we will be able to save and use the same folder so we all can be up to date to what everyone is doing
If there are any complications please let me know on the README whiteboard on the website Miro, also know how to use github, and also first create branches before commit the changes, only commit the changes when there is no bugs, the execption being if you don't make any ground breaking bugs, and only simple bugs can be put in the main branch
