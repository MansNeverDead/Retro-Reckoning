# Retro Reckoning
From here we will be able to save and use the same folder so we all can be up to date to what everyone is doing
If there are any complications please let me know on the README whiteboard on the website Miro, also know how to use github, and also first create branches before commit the changes, only commit the changes when 
there is no bugs, the execption being if you don't make any ground breaking bugs, for simple bugs create a new branch and when it has been fixed than it can be pushed to main, always wait for the Project Manager to 
finish look and accept the code/progress before pushiing to main, so you need to create a new branch whenever you make progress and commit there
